1. Line 9 prints the value 20.
2. Line 13 prints the value 20.
3. Line 9 prints the value 20.
4. Line 13 throws an error. Unlike `var`, the `let` keyword has a block scope. Since `let result = 0` is declared inside the `if` statement, `result` is only visible inside the `if` block. Therefore, when we try to print it outside of the `if` block on line 13, an error is thrown becasue `result` doesn't exist here.
5. Line 9 does not print anything. The `const` keyword is used when we want to define a constant, and we are not allowed to change it. On Line 7, we try to redefine `result`, which we declared as a `const`. This causes an error, thus leading to Line 9 never being called.
6. Similar to the previous answer, Line 13 is never called because Line 7 throws an error. It is noteworthy that `const` is also block-scoped, so even if we did not try to modify `result`, trying to print it on Line 13 would cause an error.
